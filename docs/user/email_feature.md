    Hi Mr, ABC
    <br>
    Please find attached Screenshots for details

    $screenshot[1]

    <br> Screen shot for second screen

    $screenshot[2]

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Thanks, 
    <br><b>Feature Name</b>
    <br><b>Co.meta</b>
    ```
    - Screenshots will be included in the email body in the sequence they are enabled in the steps. The placeholders $screenshot[1], $screenshot[2], etc., correspond to the screenshots of the steps that have the screenshot option enabled.
    - When an email is received, you will see that the screenshots are attached as images in the same sequence as they are mentioned in the mail body template above.
