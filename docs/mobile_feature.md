### Introduction

Automated tests on mobile devices are crucial for ensuring software quality, efficiency, and consistency. 

They help detect errors quickly, reduce testing time, and are scalable, allowing for testing across multiple device configurations without manual intervention. 

Statistics show that 80% of companies adopting automated testing report increased software quality and shorter delivery times. By implementing a feature that automates these steps with a mobile emulator, you can significantly improve workflow and application reliability.

### Start Mobile

Why is the Start button activated for mobile device containers?

Once manually activated, access to the mobile device is available through the predefined steps provided in the Feature's Step Editor.

These mobile containers can be initialized, paused, and restarted.

Mobile containers can be accessed in two ways:

  * Through the Feature.
  * Through the Landing Tree.

To work with the feature, follow these steps:

Go to the feature of the desired department and click on Modify.

Click on Start Mobile or use the shortcut <strong>shortcut(S)</strong>:

### Landing tree

If working from the Landing Tree is preferred, select the desired department to use the mobile device functionality as follows:

<img src="https://github.com/cometa-rocks/cometa_documentation/blob/main/img/mobile_feature/tree_mobile_device.png" width="200px" height="300px">

First, select the department and start the desired mobile device.

Next, choose the mobile container and start it:

Once started, the emulator can be paused if needed.

If paused, it can be restarted to resume operation.

Note: If the package is not available, upload it through the Upload option in <strong>Edit Feature</strong>, ensuring the package is in APK format.
Additionally, an APK package can be installed on the mobile device.

<img src="https://github.com/cometa-rocks/cometa_documentation/blob/main/img/mobile_feature/upload_apk.png" width="1000px">

Now, go to the Emulator Feature, click on the more_vert (â‹®) icon, and select <strong>Modify</strong>. From there, upload the package in APK format to make it available.

<img src="https://github.com/cometa-rocks/cometa_documentation/blob/main/img/mobile_feature/more_vert_emulator.png" width="400px">

Once in the Modify section, four tabs will be displayed: Information, Install APK, Installed APK, and Share Emulator.

Install APK: Allows uploading an APK file for installation.

<img src="https://github.com/cometa-rocks/cometa_documentation/blob/main/img/mobile_feature/dialog_install_apk.png" width="1000px">

Installed APK: Displays a list of already installed APKs.

Share Emulator: Provides options to share the emulator instance.

Feature Emulator Shared: Shows the emulator in shared mode.

### Shared Mobiles

To view the mobile devices of other colleagues in the same department, scroll down until reaching "Shared Mobile."

### Live Steps

Once the steps related to the mobile device are completed, access to the noVNC of the desired mobile will be available.
When reaching the step where the mobile is loaded, the noVNC will become visible, allowing the mobile to be viewed.

### Main view

Once all steps are completed, the result will appear as the second icon (a camera).
If there is one mobile, it will display directly; if multiple, a dropdown will allow selection.
Additionally, there is a 'Mobile' column that shows the mobile name.
