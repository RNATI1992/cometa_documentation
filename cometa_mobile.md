# Co.meta mobile feature 
1. [Start Mobile](#start-mobile)

<br/>

### Start mobile<a id="CSS_AC"></a>

Why do we activate the Start button for mobile device containers?

Once manually activated, you will be able to access the mobile device through the predefined steps we provide in the Feature's Step Editor.

These mobile containers can be initialized, paused, and restarted.

You can access mobile containers in two ways:

  * Through the Feature.
  * Through the Landing Tree.

If you want to work with the feature, you need to follow these steps:

If you prefer to work from the Landing Tree, select the department you want and use the mobile device functionality as follows:

Select the mobile device component.
