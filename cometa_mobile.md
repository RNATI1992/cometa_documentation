### Start mobile (Edit Feature) <a id="CSS_AC"></a>

Why do we activate the Start button for mobile device containers?

Once manually activated, you will be able to access the mobile device through the predefined steps we provide in the Feature's Step Editor.

These mobile containers can be initialized, paused, and restarted.

You can access mobile containers in two ways:

  * Through the Feature.
  * Through the Landing Tree.

If you want to work with the feature, you need to follow these steps:

Go to the feature of the department you want.

Click on Start Mobile or <strong>shortcut(S)</strong>:

Next step, we have to chose the mobile container and start it:

Note: If you donâ€™t have the package, you must upload it through the Upload option in Edit Feature, ensuring that the package is in APK format.
Additionally, you can install an APK package for the mobile device.

### Start mobile (Landing Tree)<a id="CSS_AC"></a>

If you prefer to work from the Landing Tree, select the department you want and use the mobile device functionality as follows:

First select the department and start the mobile device of your choice.

Once the department is selected, the "Start" button will become enabled.

### Shared mobile (Edit Feature) <a id="CSS_AC"></a>

To view the mobile devices of other colleagues in the same department, we need to scroll down until we reach "Shared Mobile."

### Live steps (Edit Feature) <a id="CSS_AC"></a>

Once the steps related to the mobile device are completed, we will be able to access the noVNC of the desired mobile. 
Once we reach the step where the mobile is loaded, the novnc will become visible, and we can view the mobile.

### Main-view (results) <a id="CSS_AC"></a>

Once all steps are completed, the result will appear as the second icon (a camera).
If there's one mobile, it will display directly; if multiple, a dropdown will allow selection.
